        The <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> is a wrought-iron lattice Tower
        on the <mark>Champ de Mars</mark> in Paris, France.
        It is named after the engineer <mark>Gustave Eiffel</mark>
        whose company designed and built the Tower
    </p>
    <p>
        The tower is 330 meters(1.083ft) tall, about the same height as 
        an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its
        base is square, measuring 125 meters(410 ft) on each side. During
        its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument
        to become the tallest structure in Paris.
